The project was created during the lecture "Software Personalization Technologies" course of the postgraduate program "Advanced Computer Systems" of the Department of Computer Science of the University of Piraeus. The aim was to demonstrate how one can implement an educational web application with personalised content from scratch.

It was not possible to complete it in one lecture. However, it could be an excellent first step for anyone interested in studying and extending the code. The project is written using the Spring framework.
